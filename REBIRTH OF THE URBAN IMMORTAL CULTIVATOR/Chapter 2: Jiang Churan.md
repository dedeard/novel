## Chapter 2: Jiang Churan

Chen Fan, lost in thought, receives a call from his mother. She informs him about arrangements made by Auntie Tang in Chu Zhou City due to his low grades. Despite the scolding, hearing his mother's voice after centuries brings warmth and tears to Chen Fan. He promises to study hard. Chen Fan reflects on his mother, Wang Xiaoyun, a willful woman who defied her family and built the Splendor Real Estate Group. Her death made him realize her significance, and he expresses concern for her safety. The call reveals Auntie Tang's desire to set him up with her daughter, Jiang Churan, a straight-A student. Chen Fan laughs at the idea, knowing studying is a priority. The conversation also touches on financial support and his mother's business. As the call ends, Chen Fan reflects on regrets from his past life, particularly regarding his sister An Ya. The bus arrives at its destination. Chen Fan, realizing he's back to being seventeen, reflects on his improved situation. Outside the bus terminal, Auntie Tang and her daughter Jiang Churan wait for Chen Fan. Jiang Churan, annoyed by the situation, is displeased at the prospect of being set up with him. Chen Fan arrives, politely greeting Auntie Tang, and Jiang Churan assesses him critically. She finds him ordinary and not as impressive as Li Yichen, her classmate and pursuer. Auntie Tang introduces Jiang Churan, asking Chen Fan to look after her in school. Chen Fan agrees, promising to treat her like a sister. As he turns to face Jiang Churan, memories of their past surface. Chen Fan reminisces about his past infatuation with Jiang Churan, acknowledging the impracticality of their relationship. In the present, he extends a friendly hand to Jiang Churan, promising help and friendship. Jiang Churan accepts but views him as a friend at best due to economic differences. Auntie Tang drives them to Chen Fan's new house, expressing genuine care for him. Grateful, Chen Fan prepares to repay Auntie Tang's kindness. As they head to the Tang family residence, Jiang Churan loses interest in Chen Fan, assuming he's playing a game of indifference. Unbeknownst to her, Chen Fan is preoccupied with thoughts of his cultivation.
