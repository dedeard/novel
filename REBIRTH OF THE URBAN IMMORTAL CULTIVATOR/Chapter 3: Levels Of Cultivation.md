## Chapter 3: Levels Of Cultivation

Chen Fan, a cultivator, prioritizes regaining his power, crucial in a universe where reaching the seventh level makes one a "True Immortal." Having surpassed his teacher and achieved the eighth level, titled "Celestial Lord," he reflects on Earth's diminished Spirit Qi and the rise of the Earth Federation in the interstellar era. Disappointed by the lack of cultivators, he plans to enhance his power by reaching level two, dismissing the need for advanced technology. Despite Earth's limited Spirit Qi, Chen Fan remains determined, contemplating the possibility of breaking through with a numinous treasure, although he acknowledges the scarcity of such resources on Earth. Chen Fan arrives at Auntie Tang's house, located in the Dragon's View Garden, a high-end residential area. Auntie Tang shares details about the expensive villas in the mountains, expressing envy. Chen Fan, confident in his future success, promises to buy her a few of those villas. Despite Jiang Churan's initial disappointment in Chen Fan's seeming emptiness of promises, Auntie Tang appreciates his gesture and invites Chen Fan's mother to live with her. Inside the well-decorated house, they encounter Jiang Churan's father, Deputy Director Jiang Haishan. Auntie Tang prepares tea, and Jiang Churan impresses Chen Fan with her refined tea-making skills, revealing a level of training he hadn't noticed before. Jiang Haishan, Deputy Director of Chu Zhou City, engages in a conversation with Chen Fan. Jiang Haishan inquires about Chen Fan's father, Reeve Chen, and praises his recent proposal on sustainable development. However, Chen Fan remains disinterested in political matters. Jiang Haishan shifts the conversation to Chen Fan's mother's real estate business in Zhong Hai City, expressing skepticism about Auntie Tang's exaggerated claims. When discussing academic performance, Jiang Haishan is disappointed by Chen Fan's lack of ambition and knowledge. He emphasizes the importance of education for success and subtly hints at concerns about Chen Fan's suitability as a future son-in-law. Despite his wife's matchmaking plans, Jiang Haishan is not convinced that Chen Fan is the right match for his daughter, Jiang Churan.
