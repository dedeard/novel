## Chapter 1: I Am Back

In 2007, a Golden Dragon Travel Service bus headed to Si Shui County carried a young man named Chen Fan. Having recently awakened from a nightmare, he realized he had returned to the mortal world after escaping a celestial tribulation. Known as Chen Beixuan, a renowned cultivator, he had spent five centuries cultivating under the True Martial Immortal Sect and earned the title of The North Mystic Celestial Lord. Despite his past invincibility, Chen Fan lost himself in the tribulation due to the hasty pace of his cultivation. Facing mental demons, his resolution crumbled, and guilt consumed him. Awakening on the bus, he found himself stripped of his celestial powers. However, he embraced this setback with lighthearted laughter, determined to perfect his cultivation this time and return the humiliation he had suffered. Reflecting on his past life, Chen Fan remembered his regrets and sorrows, especially the love he lost and the disdain from the Wang Family. Born in Si Shui County to an ordinary family, his parents' love faced opposition from the prestigious Wang Family. Despite societal hostility, his parents persevered, settling in Si Shui County. Chen Fan's resolve strengthened as he contemplated revenge against Shen Junwen and the Wang Family. His determination to avenge his mother and rewrite the narrative of his life burned bright. With a newfound resolution, Chen Fan embraced the journey ahead, seeking justice and redemption for the miseries of his past. Chen Gexin, Chen Fan's father, worked diligently for decades in Si Shui County, rising to a managerial position. Despite his achievements, the Wang Family's disdain persisted due to his humble origins. The tension eased somewhat after Chen Fan's birth, but the Wangs continued to view them with contempt, considering them a stain on the family's reputation. Chen Fan, once a cultivator, reflected on his past life's struggles with the Wang Family. His cousin, Wang Chen, epitomized the family's arrogance. The Wangs' callous behavior at Chen Fan's mother's funeral fueled his determination for revenge. Although centuries had passed, the memories of the Wangs remained a source of turmoil for Chen Fan, a vulnerability that could attract mental demons. To avoid dwelling on the past, Chen Fan redirected his focus to Shen Junwen, his romantic rival who caused his downfall. Shen, a wealthy magnate, not only stole Chen Fan's love, Xiao Qiong, but also played a role in the collapse of Chen Fan's mother's company. Despite five centuries passing, Chen Fan harbored deep-seated anger, vowing retribution against Shen Junwen, the Fang Family, and the Wang Family. As he embarked on the path of revenge, Chen Fan, now known as Chen Beixuan, was fueled by determination and a desire to rectify the injustices of his past life. His cultivation journey aimed at settling scores and reclaiming what he had lost, marking the beginning of a new chapter in his quest for retribution.
