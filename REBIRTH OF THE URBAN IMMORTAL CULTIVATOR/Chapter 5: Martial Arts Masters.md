## Chapter 5: Martial Arts Masters

Chen Fan opens his eyes after completing his cultivation, noting the remarkable progress achieved in just one attempt. Excited about the potential to reach Ethereal Enlightenment within six months, he attributes the rapid advancement to both his past cultivation experience and the unique Art of Void Mortal Refinement. Testing his newfound strength, Chen Fan punches a willow tree, leaving a deep impression and realizing the significant enhancement in his physical power. Although he acknowledges the progress, Chen Fan remains dissatisfied, comparing his current strength to his past abilities. Feeling hungry, he decides it's time to eat and notices three people approaching him as he leaves the willow trees. Chen Fan immersed himself in the joy of his cultivation achievements, harnessing the power of herbs using a basic array formation called the "Spirit Robbing Array." This technique allowed him to draw out the spirit qi from the herbs and fuse it with his own energy. Despite the low quality of Earth's herb medicines, Chen Fan found this method to be effective in improving his cultivation. As he finished his cultivation session, he contemplated the cost of herbs and the financial strain it placed on him. Chen Fan was frustrated by the expenses and realized that he had spent most of the money his mother had given him. Concerned about the affordability of future cultivation endeavors, he sighed at the high cost of progressing on the path of cultivation. Chen Fan looked at the girl with the ponytail and the old man behind her. He had observed her martial arts practice and noted the presence of internal energy, which he deemed weaker and simpler than the arcane energy of cultivators. The difference between internal energy and arcane energy, in Chen Fan's eyes, was like that of diesel and rocket fuelsâ€”both fuels, but with significantly varying power. As the girl sensed Chen Fan's critical gaze, she paused and confronted him with a hot question, "What are you staring at? Do you even understand what this is?" Chen Fan raised an eyebrow and replied, "I do. It's called internal energy, right? But it's far from the real power I've seen." The girl frowned at his response. The old man, sensing the conversation, glanced at Chen Fan again, seemingly curious about his knowledge of martial arts and cultivation. Chen Fan, however, was more interested in the potential connection between the girl and the cultivators he encountered the previous day.
